lose energy from basal metabolic rate + activity
- average BMR is 6500 kJ/day (0.075 per second) - higher in cold environment (less so if fat)
- minimum energy requirement is 7500 kJ/day (BMR + minimal sedentary activity)

there is an energy cost to digesting food, which varies based on type of nutrient:
- protein 20-30%
- carbohydrate 5-10%
- fat 0-3%

METs are a measure of the energy expended by a particular activity.
They are expressed as multiples of BMR
1 MET = BMR = completely inactive
2 METS = malking slowly
5 METS = walking briskly
11.5 METs = running

1. energy is first lost from GLYCOGENOLYSIS
   - average glycogen stores 8000 kJ ie about a day's worth of energy
   - about 1/3 in liver, 2/3 in skeletal muscle
2. once glycogen is gone, FAT (triglyceride) starts being broken down into FFAs + GLYCEROL
   - glycerol is converted to glucose in liver (GLUCONEOGENESIS)
   - FFAs are used directly for energy in peripheral tissues (everywhere but brain, FFAs cannot cross BBB)
   - average fat reserves 400,000 kJ
   - during this stage, brain is reliant on glucose from glycerol (and any food)
3. after about 3 days, FFAs start being converted into KETONES (KETOSIS)
   - ketones can cross BBB, and brain can use them in place of glucose
4. once fat reserves are getting low, MUSCLE starts being broken down
   - glucose is formed from amino acids (alanine) via GLUCONEOGENESIS

food intake adds to energy
if starved, recovery should be slow
should not use 100% of fat before starting to break down protein - obese people do start to break down protein while some fat reserves remain

"buckets" - glycogen, fat, protein, carbohydrate

game effects of starvation
X reduced maximum health (show "cap" on health bar)
- reduced regeneration rate of health 
- slow movement

TODO
* move METS calc to server?



Cold weather

Shivering can increase BMR by up to 5 fold
Adaptation to cold environment: BMR is increased by 15-30%

Weight loss during starvation
first day: 1 kg
first 5 days: 0.5 kg/day
by day 21, falls to 0.3 kg/day and remains stable after that

BMI 12 or lower is generally unrecoverable
